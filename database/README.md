# Database
Currently using a .csv file as the database.
Will move to a mySQL database later on if time permits.

### user_email
	email registered to user account
	
### user_rating
	The mode rating of the user from past journeys
	
### history of journeys
    This column should keep trap of the journeys
    the user has signed up to and record if
    user went on the journeys or if the user cancelled
    
(**Should we generate a file for each user that contains this data?)
